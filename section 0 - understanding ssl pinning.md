# Section 0: Understanding SSL Pinning

## Overview
This section provides fundamental understanding of SSL certificate pinning concepts, behaviors, and scenarios. It serves as the foundation for all implementation teams to understand how pinning works and what to expect in different situations.

## Content

### 0.1 What is SSL Certificate Pinning?

SSL Certificate Pinning is a **client-side** security technique that hardcodes or "pins" specific certificates or public keys within an application. Instead of trusting any certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), the application only accepts certificates that match the predefined pins.

**üîë Critical Understanding: Pinning is Client-Side Only**

SSL pinning is **only enforced on the client side**. The server never "pins" anything ‚Äî it simply presents its TLS certificate as it normally would.

**Key Points:**
- **Server Role:** Presents TLS certificate (same behavior whether client pins or not)
- **Client Role:** Validates presented certificate against stored pins
- **Control Point:** All pinning logic resides in client applications
- **Server Awareness:** Server has no knowledge of client pinning behavior

**Implications:**
- **To enable pinning:** Client must implement pin validation logic
- **To disable pinning:** Client must remove, bypass, or kill-switch the pinning logic
- **Server changes:** Do not affect pinning behavior (only certificate presentation)
- **Pin management:** Entirely controlled by client-side configuration

**Key Concepts:**
- **SPKI (Subject Public Key Info)**: The public key portion of a certificate, hashed with SHA-256
- **Pin**: A specific SPKI hash that the application will accept
- **Backup Pin**: An additional pin for certificate rotation without app updates
- **Kill-Switch**: Emergency mechanism to disable pinning remotely

### 0.2 SPKI Pinning vs Certificate Renewal

**üîë Critical Understanding: Pin the Key, Not the Certificate**

With SPKI (public-key) pinning, you only need to change pins when the keypair changes, not when the certificate simply renews.

#### What Happens at Annual Certificate Renewal?

**Certificate Renewal with Same Keypair:**
- If you reuse the same keypair (same public key) and only renew the cert (new validity, serial, etc.)
- The SPKI hash stays the same ‚Üí your existing pin continues to work
- **No app update required**

**Certificate Renewal with New Keypair:**
- If you generate a new keypair during renewal, the SPKI hash changes
- You must have already shipped the backup pin (new key) or the app will fail
- **App update may be required if backup pin not already deployed**

#### Practical Policy for Key Management

**üõ°Ô∏è Keep Stable Keypairs Across Routine Renewals**
- Reuse the same keypair for routine renewals (e.g., 90-day Let's Encrypt or 1-year CA certs)
- This avoids requiring app updates for every certificate renewal

**üîÑ Always Ship Two Pins in Clients:**
1. **Current pin**: Active keypair currently in use
2. **Backup pin**: Next keypair, generated in advance

**üìÖ Rotate Keys on Your Schedule, Not the CA's:**
- **Typical cadence**: Every 12‚Äì24 months, or sooner if required by:
  - Security policy requirements
  - Vendor changes (CDN/WAF provider changes)
  - Security incident response
  - Compliance requirements

#### Key Rotation Workflow

**Before a Planned Rotation:**
1. Generate the next keypair and compute its SPKI hash
2. Ship/enable the client with current + backup pins
3. Wait for app deployment and adoption
4. Flip the server to use the backup keypair at cutover
5. In a later app release, drop the old pin and add the next backup pin

#### Common Gotchas

**‚ö†Ô∏è Managed CDN/Gateway Auto-Rotation**
- CDNs that auto-rotate keys can break pinning unexpectedly
- Ensure "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) capability
- Or pre-announce the new SPKI to bake as backup pin

**üèóÔ∏è Server Infrastructure Changes (GCP ‚Üí AWS, etc.)**
- **Key Impact**: Depends on how you manage SSL certificates and keys

**Scenario 1: You Control the Private Key**
```
‚úÖ Key Stays Same:
- You export/migrate your existing private key to new infrastructure
- Same private key ‚Üí Same SPKI hash ‚Üí Pins continue to work
- Common with: Custom domains, Load balancers with imported certs
```

**Scenario 2: Infrastructure Provider Manages Keys**
```
‚ùå Key Changes:
- New infrastructure generates new key/certificate pair
- Different private key ‚Üí Different SPKI hash ‚Üí Pins break
- Common with: Managed certificates, auto-provisioned SSL
```

**Scenario 3: CDN/WAF Changes**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on Service:
- CloudFlare ‚Üí AWS CloudFront: Usually requires new certificate
- Same provider, different region: Key may or may not change
- Managed services: Often generate new keys automatically
```

**üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices for Infrastructure Changes:**
1. **Plan Ahead**: Check if you can migrate existing private keys
2. **Generate Backup**: Create backup pin for new infrastructure before migration
3. **Test in Staging**: Validate pin compatibility in non-production environment
4. **Gradual Migration**: Use backup pins during transition period
5. **Kill-Switch Ready**: Have remote config ready in case of issues

**üîç How to Check Key Changes:**
```bash
# Extract SPKI from old infrastructure
openssl s_client -connect old-server.com:443 -servername old-server.com < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64

# Extract SPKI from new infrastructure  
openssl s_client -connect new-server.com:443 -servername new-server.com < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64

# Compare the hashes - if different, you need new pins
```

**‚úÖ Intermediate/Chain Changes Don't Matter**
- SPKI pinning targets the server/leaf certificate key
- Intermediate certificate changes don't affect SPKI pins
- You're pinning the server key, not the chain

**üö® Emergency Kill-Switch Still Recommended**
- Even with stable keypairs, emergencies can happen
- Remote Config kill-switch provides safety net
- Vendor changes, security incidents, or misconfigurations

#### Bottom Line
**You don't "pin every year" ‚Äî you pin to the key, not the cert.**
- Renew certificates as often as you want (90 days, 1 year, etc.)
- Just keep the same keypair for routine renewals
- Plan key rotations separately with backup pins already shipped

### 0.3 SSL Pinning Behavior Matrix

The following table illustrates how SSL pinning behaves in different scenarios:

| Client Pinning | Server Certificate/Key | Result | Description |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|-------------|
| **OFF** | Any valid CA certificate | ‚úÖ **Works** | Normal TLS validation using system CA trust store |
| **ON** | Certificate matches pinned SPKI | ‚úÖ **Works** | Pin validation succeeds, connection established |
| **ON** | Certificate does NOT match pinned SPKI | ‚ùå **Fails** | Pinning validation fails, connection rejected |
| **OFF** | Certificate changed (valid CA) | ‚úÖ **Works** | Normal TLS accepts any valid CA-issued certificate |

### 0.3 Detailed Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Pinning Disabled (Normal TLS)
```
Client Pinning: OFF
Server: Any valid CA certificate
Result: ‚úÖ Works (normal TLS)
```
**What Happens:**
- Client performs standard TLS handshake
- Validates certificate against system CA store
- Accepts any certificate issued by trusted CA
- **Security Level:** Standard TLS (CA-based trust)

#### Scenario 2: Pinning Enabled with Matching Certificate
```
Client Pinning: ON
Server: Certificate matches pinned SPKI hash
Result: ‚úÖ Works
```
**What Happens:**
- Client performs TLS handshake
- Extracts SPKI from server certificate
- Compares SPKI hash against stored pins
- Pin matches ‚Üí Connection proceeds
- **Security Level:** Enhanced (only specific certificate accepted)

#### Scenario 3: Pinning Enabled with Non-Matching Certificate
```
Client Pinning: ON
Server: Certificate does NOT match pinned SPKI
Result: ‚ùå Fails (pinning error)
```
**What Happens:**
- Client performs TLS handshake
- Extracts SPKI from server certificate
- Compares SPKI hash against stored pins
- No pin matches ‚Üí Connection rejected immediately
- **Error:** Certificate pinning failure
- **Security Level:** Maximum protection against rogue certificates

#### Scenario 4: Certificate Rotation Without Pinning
```
Client Pinning: OFF
Server: Certificate changed (but still valid CA)
Result: ‚úÖ Works (normal TLS)
```
**What Happens:**
- Server deploys new certificate from same or different CA
- Client validates new certificate against CA store
- Valid CA signature ‚Üí Connection accepted
- **Impact:** No application changes required

### 0.4 Domain-Specific Pinning Behavior

#### Pinned Domain Requests
```
Request to: api.kreditplus.com (PINNED)
Client Behavior: Validates SPKI hash against stored pins
Success: Only if certificate matches pinned SPKI
Failure: If certificate doesn't match any stored pins
```

#### Non-Pinned Domain Requests
```
Request to: external-api.example.com (NOT PINNED)
Client Behavior: Standard TLS validation only
Success: Any valid CA-issued certificate accepted
Failure: Only if certificate is invalid or expired
```

#### Mixed Domain Scenarios
```
App makes requests to:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.kreditplus.com (PINNED) ‚Üí Pin validation required
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdn.cloudflare.com (NOT PINNED) ‚Üí Normal TLS validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ oauth.google.com (NOT PINNED) ‚Üí Normal TLS validation
```

### 0.5 Kill-Switch Scenarios

#### Kill-Switch Activation
```
Before: Client Pinning = ON
Action: Remote config sets kill_switch_active = true
After: Client Pinning = OFF (temporarily)
Result: All requests use normal TLS validation
```

**When to Use:**
- Emergency certificate replacement needed
- Pinning causing widespread failures
- Security incident requiring immediate bypass
- Certificate rotation issues

#### Kill-Switch Deactivation
```
Before: Client Pinning = OFF (kill-switch active)
Action: Remote config sets kill_switch_active = false
After: Client Pinning = ON (restored)
Result: Pin validation resumes for designated domains
```

### 0.6 Performance Impact Scenarios

#### Initial Connection (Cold Start)
```
Without Pinning: ~100ms (TLS handshake + CA validation)
With Pinning: ~145ms (TLS handshake + CA validation + SPKI extraction + pin comparison)
Additional Overhead: ~45ms
```

#### Subsequent Connections (Warm)
```
Without Pinning: ~20ms (session reuse)
With Pinning: ~25ms (session reuse + cached pin validation)
Additional Overhead: ~5ms
```

### 0.7 Error Scenarios and Handling

#### Pin Validation Failure
```
Error Type: SSL Pinning Failure
Cause: Server certificate SPKI doesn't match any stored pins
User Experience: Request fails, app shows network error
Logging: "Certificate pinning failed for api.kreditplus.com"
Recovery: Kill-switch activation or certificate fix
```

#### Network Timeout During Pin Validation
```
Error Type: Timeout
Cause: Network issues during SPKI extraction
User Experience: Request timeout
Logging: "Pin validation timeout for api.kreditplus.com"
Recovery: Retry with exponential backoff
```

#### Kill-Switch Activation Delay
```
Scenario: Kill-switch activated but not yet propagated
Current State: Pinning still active on some clients
Result: Mixed behavior across user base
Timeline: Full propagation within 5 minutes
```

### 0.8 Certificate Rotation Scenarios

#### Planned Certificate Rotation
```
Phase 1: Deploy new certificate with backup pin already in app
Phase 2: Apps validate against both old and new pins
Phase 3: Remove old pin from app in next version
Result: ‚úÖ Smooth transition with zero downtime
```

#### Emergency Certificate Replacement
```
Phase 1: Security incident requires immediate certificate change
Phase 2: New certificate deployed but no backup pin in apps
Phase 3: Kill-switch activated to allow emergency certificate
Result: ‚úÖ Service restored, enhanced pinning resumed later
```

### 0.9 Development and Testing Scenarios

#### Staging Environment Testing
```
Environment: kbfinansia.com
Certificate: Test certificate with known SPKI
Pinning: Enabled with test pins
Purpose: Validate pinning logic without production impact
```

#### Local Development
```
Environment: localhost or dev domains
Certificate: Self-signed or dev certificates
Pinning: Disabled via configuration
Purpose: Allow development without certificate constraints
```

#### Production Pilot
```
Environment: api.kreditplus.com
Certificate: Production certificate
Pinning: Enabled for small user percentage (1-5%)
Purpose: Real-world validation before full rollout
```

### 0.10 Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "Certificate Pinning Failed" Error
**Symptoms:** App cannot connect to pinned domains
**Possible Causes:**
- Certificate rotated without updating backup pins
- Wrong SPKI hash in pin configuration
- Network proxy interfering with certificate

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Verify current server certificate SPKI
2. Check pin configuration matches
3. Activate kill-switch if needed
4. Update pins and redeploy

#### Mixed Success/Failure Rates
**Symptoms:** Some users connect successfully, others fail
**Possible Causes:**
- Certificate rotation in progress
- CDN serving different certificates
- Geographic distribution issues

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check certificate consistency across all servers
2. Verify CDN configuration
3. Monitor geographic failure patterns
4. Consider gradual kill-switch activation
