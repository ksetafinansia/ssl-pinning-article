# Section 7: Rollout & Contingency

## Overview
This section details the phased rollout strategy for SSL pinning implementation and emergency contingency procedures, including kill-switch activation protocols.

## Content

### 7.1 Rollout Timeline

#### T-30 to T-21 (Preparation Phase)
**Activities:**
- Generate current + backup pins
- Implement remote kill-switch in clients
- Add telemetry for pin success/failure

**Deliverables:**
- SPKI pin registry populated
- Kill-switch functionality tested
- Telemetry collection validated

#### T-20 to T-14 (Latent Release Phase)
**Activities:**
- Release app with pinning code + kill-switch
- Default flag OFF (pinning disabled)
- Staged rollout in app stores

**Deliverables:**
- Applications deployed with pinning capability
- Remote configuration system active
- App store approvals completed

#### T-13 to T-7 (Pilot Cohort Phase)
**Activities:**
- Enable pinning ON (via remote flag) for 1–5% of users on `api.kreditplus.com`
- Observe telemetry; ramp gradually
- Monitor for unexpected failures

**Key Metrics:**
- Pin success rate > 99.5%
- No increase in API errors
- Normal application performance

#### T-6 to T-3 (Pilot Expansion Phase)
**Activities:**
- Increase rollout to 25–50% users
- Validate no spike in failures
- Prepare production deployment

**Validation Points:**
- Telemetry confirms stable operation
- User experience remains unaffected
- Infrastructure handles increased validation load

#### T-2 to T-0 (Full Pilot Phase)
**Activities:**
- Enable 100% for pilot domain
- Keep kill-switch available
- Final production readiness validation

#### T+7 onward (Production Phase)
**Activities:**
- Enable pinning for `kreditplus.com` gradually (5% → 25% → 100%)
- Maintain kill-switch for 2–4 weeks
- Continuous monitoring and optimization

### 7.2 Contingency (Kill-Switch)

#### Activation Methods
**Mobile Applications:**
- Remote config disables pinning check
- TLS validation continues normally
- Instant deployment capability

**Server Applications:**
- Set `SSL_PINNING_ENABLED=false` environment variable
- Application restart not required
- Load balancer configuration bypass

#### Security Impact Assessment
**Pinning ON:**
- Client only trusts our exact server key
- Maximum security posture
- Protection against rogue CAs

**Pinning OFF:**
- Client trusts any CA-issued certificate
- Standard TLS security level
- Potential rogue CA impersonation risk
- Traffic remains encrypted

#### Emergency Response Rules
1. **Always ship with kill-switch** - No deployment without emergency bypass
2. **Document activation procedures** - Clear step-by-step emergency response
3. **Test kill-switch regularly** - Quarterly validation of emergency procedures
4. **Monitor post-activation** - Increased security monitoring when pinning disabled

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollout Risks
- Gradual percentage-based deployment
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Automated rollback triggers
- 24/7 support team availability

### Contingency Risks
- Time-limited kill-switch activation
- Enhanced monitoring during bypass period
- Expedited certificate rotation capabilities
- Communication protocols for security teams
