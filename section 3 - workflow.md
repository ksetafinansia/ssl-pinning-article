# Section 3: Workflow

## Overview
This section defines the high-level implementation workflow across environments, ensuring proper testing and validation before production deployment.

## Content

### Environment Progression
1. **Test in staging** (`kbfinansia.com`)
2. **Pilot rollout** in `api.kreditplus.com`
3. **Enforce in production** (`kreditplus.com`)

## Detailed Workflow

### Stage 1: Staging Environment Testing
**Objective:** Validate pinning implementation in controlled environment
- Deploy pinning configuration to `kbfinansia.com`
- Test certificate mismatch scenarios
- Verify kill-switch functionality
- Validate telemetry collection

### Stage 2: Pilot Environment Rollout
**Objective:** Limited production testing with real users
- Enable pinning for `api.kreditplus.com`
- Gradual user cohort expansion (1% → 5% → 25% → 100%)
- Monitor failure rates and user impact
- Collect performance metrics

### Stage 3: Production Enforcement
**Objective:** Full production deployment with monitoring
- Enable pinning for `kreditplus.com`
- Maintain kill-switch availability
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
- Incident response readiness

## Quality Gates
- Each stage requires explicit approval before progression
- Automated testing validation at each transition
- Rollback procedures documented and tested
- Performance impact assessment completed
